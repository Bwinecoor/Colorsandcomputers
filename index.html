        <h2 class="s-head">General Information</h2>
        <p>
          Colors can be represented in many formats and models. The most common
          models are RGB, RYB, and RGBA. RGB has 3 color channels, red green and
          blue. RGBA is the same but there is an extra transparency/alpha
          channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          RYB is unique because it is used in paint rather than computers.
          Instead of green being a primary color, yellow is.
          <br />
          CMYK is another model. Unlike RGB, this is a subtractive color model
          meaning no color is white and all color is black. This is usually used
          in printers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Onto formats, the 3 main ones are hexadecimal, decimal/fixed 0-1, and
          integer 0-255. Hexadecimal is 6-8 digits, each two representing the
          intensity of a color channel from 00 to FF. Sometimes hexadecimal has
          a prefix '#' or '0x' to differentiate from other formats
          <br />
          Integer is 3-4 whole numbers between 0 and 255. This is almost
          identical to hexadecimal, but each pair of digits are converted to
          decimal numbers.
          <br />
          Decimal is 3-4 values between 0 and 1, or a percentage 0%-100%. It can
          also be called fixed because it is often implemented using 8-bit fixed
          point numbers.
        </p>

        <!-- A common one is hexadecimal.
          This is 6 digits along with a prefix '#' or '0x'.
          Each two digits represent a intensity of the red, green, and blue between 0 and 255<br>
          Another format which is similar to hexadecimal is bytes.
          The only difference is that instead of 6 digits, this has 3 numbers.<br>
          Colors can also be one number, from 0 to 2^24, higher values are blue, lower are red. -->

      <div class="color-s" id="black-s">
        <h2 class="s-head">Black</h2>
        <div>

        </div>
        <p>
          Black is a simple, but very common color. The hex code for solid black
          is 0x000000, which means display no color. Even though it is
          technically not a color, some devices will display a very dark color
          visually identical to black instead of turning off the pixels.

        </div>
        <p>
          One of the primary colors of both light and paint, blue's main hex
          code is 0x0000FF. Another common shade of blue is 0x007BFF, this is
          the default in <i>Bootstrap</i>, a popular web library developed by
          Twitter.

        </div>
        <p>
          A less common color not often found in programs or websites. This
          color has many shades and there is no single color value to describe
          it. Brown is often considered unappealing in designs, and it does not
          blend well with other colors.
        </p>

          <span>#808080<br />(128,128,128)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          In computers, silver describes a shade of white, usually right between
          black and white. It contains an equal mix of the R, G, and B color
          channels. One shade of silver is 0x808080, 50% of each channel.

        </div>
        <p>
          A primary color of light, but unlike red and blue it is not primary in
          paint. This usually represents success of some task in a computer. In
          hexadecimal, lime green is 0x00FF00.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          This is a shade of yellow, with more red than green. The shade shown
          above is 0xFF8000. It's usages in technology are similar to yellow, it
          often represents a warning and some computer displays use orange
          instead of white to lessen blue and green light.

        <div>
          <span>#8000FF <br />(128,0,255)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another color with many variations. This is a combination of mostly
          blue and red. It can be combined with some green to provide a brighter
          look. One hex code for it is 0x8000FF, which is 100% blue and 50% red.

        </div>
        <p>
          Red is utilized in websites and programs to emphasize important
          information or messages. For example, errors and dangerous operations
          will often have red text, while exit buttons will be colored red.

      <div class="color-s" id="white-s">

        <div>
          <span>#FFFFFF <br />(255,255,255)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is every color combined into one. White is one of the most common
          colors, and is often used as the default for backgrounds, bright
          objects, text, and loading screens. The hex code is 0xFFFFFF.

          <span>#FFFF00 <br />(255,255,0)</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          The only primary color in paint which is not also a primary color of
          light. This color is sometimes preffered over white because of how
          blue light affects people's eyes. All modern operating systems contain
          a method of lowering or removing blue light from the display,
          resulting in white changing to a shade of yellow.
